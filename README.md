# Algorithmic Bioinformatics Course (Wintersemester 2024)

The lecture follows chapters of the book "Compeau, Phillip_ Pevzner, Pavel - Bioinformatics algorithms. an active learning approach. (2015)", which is freely available. 

The Python scripts provided here represent my solution approaches for various problems described in the book.

Many of these problems and their description can also be found here: https://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/?location=bioinformatics-textbook-track
