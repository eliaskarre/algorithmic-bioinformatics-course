# Algorithmic Bioinformatics Course (Wintersemester 2024)

This repository shows my practical work in algorithmic bioinformatics by implementing chapter exercises of the textbook by Pevzner & Compeau.

<b>"Compeau, Phillip Pevzner, Pavel - Bioinformatics algorithms. an active learning approach. (2015)" </b> https://www.bioinformaticsalgorithms.org/read-the-book 

The Python scripts provided here represent my solution approaches for various problems in bioinformatics described in mentioned book.

Many of these problems and their description can also be found here: https://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/?location=bioinformatics-textbook-track
